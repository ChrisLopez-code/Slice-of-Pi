    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: left;">What justifies these as safest states?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        For this, we calculate the crime per capita. The state with the least crime per capita
        will be considered as the safest state relative to all of the others. This information should be
        taken into consideration if you are looking at moving to specific parts of the country!
