            <p>These statistics will give you a better understanding about what types of crimes are committed in this 
                community. This type of information should be compared and contrasted with other searches you have made, in order to gauge the 
                risk between both communities.

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of Offenses</h2>
            <p>Offenses such as homicide, arson, and aggravated assault are generally easy to understand. However, we understand
                that there is possible confusion when it comes to property-crime, violent-crime, and burglary compared to robbery.
                Here are some definitions to keep in mind when viewing these statistics offense types. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Burglary: Entry into a home/business with the intent to commit a crime (such as theft).</li>
                    <li>Robbery: Forcing an individual to hand over personal property under violence or threat of violence (may fall under category of violent-crime).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">State Definition Differences.</h2>
            <p>Be sure to look up exact definitons for crimes in your areas to be able to get a full understanding of the community beyond the amount of 
                crimes that occur. Definitions will vary from state to state, so be sure to look up your states definition of things such as larceny, or assault.
