        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Understand the community</h2>
        <p>These statistics will give you a better understanding about what types of crimes are committed in this 
            community. In this instance @ViewBag.cityName, in @ViewBag.stateAbbrev, has a high amount of {Offense Type}. 
            From this you can make the conclusion: "Is it worth moving here with a high amount of {Offense Type}?" This
            type of information should be compared and contrasted with other searches you have made, in order to gauge the 
            risk between both communities.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of Offenses</h2>
        <p>Offenses such as homicide, arson, and aggravated assault are generally easy to understand. However, we understand
            that there is possible confusion when it comes to property-crime, violent-crime, and burglary compared to robbery.
            Here are some definitions to keep in mind when viewing these statistics offense types. 
            <ul>
                <li>Property-Crime: Is a crime with the intent to gain money or property.</li>
                <li>Violent-Crime: A crime that involves an individual being harmed or threatened with violence.</li>
                <li>Burglary: Entry into a home/business with the intent to commit a crime (such as theft).</li>
                <li>Robbery: Forcing an individual to hand over personal property under violence or threat of violence (may fall under category of violent-crime).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
